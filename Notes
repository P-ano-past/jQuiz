AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score





-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

id="#start-button" onclick="startGame()" 




function startGame() {
    let timer = (whatever a timer is here)
    
   if (correctAnswer == true) {
       
   }

}

HTML:
create document div for populating the items on the screen. 
id="display"

1. Need a "Start" button to first populate and then disappear once clicked. 
    $(start)on.("click", function(){
        (jQuery research: populating into a div)
    })

2. Once the "Start" button is clicked, a timer needs to initiate at 60000ms and 1 p tag as a question with 4 answers as buttons need to populate. 

3. each of the questions answered correctly gets added +10000ms, incorrect -10000ms (plus 10 seconds, minus 10 seconds?)

4. REGARDLESS IF THE QUESTION IS ANSWERED RIGHT OR WRONG, clear the screen and populate the next set. 



JS:
(clear) please refer to "exampleindex.html" for how to clear the page from each question. (line 113)
(populate)
